# fakeTwitterProject
A self-assigned mini-project to reproduce Twitter's functionality locally. Will eventually migrate to databases rather than local array objects.
This is my first upload to github and it's visibly janky, so I am sorry for that.
The edit.ejs, explore.ejs, home.ejs, new.ejs, newUser.ejs, profile.ejs, show.ejs files are nested within a views folder which also contains a partials folder for my
footer, header, navbar and sidebar folders. the styles.css is for one or two things only, so far, but is contained within a "public" folder.

# fakeTwitterProject
A self-assigned mini-project to reproduce Twitter's functionality locally. Will eventually migrate to databases rather than local array objects.
This is my first upload to github and it's probably visibly janky, so I am sorry for that.

This project was initiated largely to give myself some practice with some concepts I had recently learnt on my Web Developer Bootcamp. I was keen to work with express to produce PATCH, POST, GET and DELETE requests and work with EJS to improve my familiarity with it all. The visual layout needs a massive update, but within a day and a half's work, I was able to produce a wide variety of local functionality. As the project does not use a database to store information, users and "breets" are stored on local array objects. Currently, it is possible to post a "breet", like, or unlike one (as long as it is not your own), edit and delete one (as long as it is your own), change user, add new users, see their profile, expand a single "breet" and enjoy a home feed dynamically built based upon who the selected user follows. Breets are also timestamped.
